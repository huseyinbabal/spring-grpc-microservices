# Task List — Cargo Tracking Platform

Flat checklist derived from [`plan.md`](./plan.md). **One task = one PR.**
PR titles are the code-block strings next to each task.

Checkpoints (`CF1`, `C1`–`C9`, `CY1`–`CY4`) are human review gates —
stop at each checkpoint and confirm before starting the next phase.

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations (CI + compose scaffold)

- [x] **TX.1** `ci: add buf lint + breaking GitHub Actions workflow`
- [x] **TY.1** `deploy(compose): stack scaffold with Kafka`
- [ ] **CF1 — CHECKPOINT:** `docker compose -f compose.yaml config` clean; `docker compose up -d kafka` healthy

## Phase 1 — common-grpc (Slice 1)

- [x] **T1.1** `common-grpc: scaffold module + parent pom`  *(CI now runs mvn verify)*
- [x] **T1.2** `common-grpc: JwtAuthInterceptor`
- [x] **T1.3** `common-grpc: GrpcExceptionAdvice`
- [ ] **C1 — CHECKPOINT:** `mvn -pl common-grpc verify` green on CI

> T1.4 (`MtlsClientConfig` helper) was dropped — mTLS between services is deferred past v0.1.0.

## Phase 2a — Shipment CRUD (Slice 2)

- [x] **T2.1** `proto: commit cargo/common/v1 + cargo/shipment/v1`
- [x] **T2.2** `shipment: scaffold Spring Boot module + gRPC starter`
- [x] **T2.3** `shipment: Flyway V1 schema + JPA entity + repo`
- [x] **T2.4** `shipment: RPC CreateShipment`
- [x] **T2.5** `shipment: RPC GetShipment (id + tracking_code oneof)`
- [x] **T2.6** `shipment: RPC ListShipments w/ pagination + filters`
- [x] **T2.7** `shipment: RPC UpdateShipmentStatus + legal transitions`
- [x] **T2.8** `shipment: RPC CancelShipment`
- [ ] **C2 — CHECKPOINT:** 5 RPCs green under Testcontainers PG

## Phase 2b — Outbox + Debezium (Slice 3)

## Phase 2c — Shipment in the compose stack

- [x] **TY.S1** `shipment: multi-stage Dockerfile (JLink JRE)`

- [x] **TY.S3** `deploy(compose): postgres-shipment + debezium connect`
- [x] **TY.S4** `deploy(compose): shipment service`
- [x] **CY1 — CHECKPOINT:** shipment runs in compose; `grpcurl CreateShipment` → event on `cargo.shipment.events`

## Phase 3c — Sync enrichment (Slice 6)

## Phase 3d — Tracking in the compose stack

- [ ] **TY.T1** `tracking: multi-stage Dockerfile`
- [ ] **TY.T2** `ci: tracking image build + push to GHCR`
- [ ] **TY.T3** `deploy(compose): postgres-tracking + tracking service`
- [ ] **CY2 — CHECKPOINT:** tracking consumes shipment events from in-stack Kafka
